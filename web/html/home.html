                <p>
                    The IoT Power project was created to mediate a problem that the HvA was having. The problem arose because of the many digital devices that are present on the HvA. With all these devices there are not enough power outlets.
                    This problem is tackled by the IoT Power team. Our team wants to mediate the problem by making a lending system for power outlets.
                    Power outlets could already be lend at the HvA but there was no easy system to do this. To make lending power outlets a more easy and pleasant experience the IoT Power team developed a power outlet lending station.

                <p>
                    The power outlet station is an easy to use locker that stores power outlets. A student can scan their HvA card at the power station and a locker will open. When a student is done using the power outlet the student can easily return the cable by scanning their card again.
                    In this way lending power outlets has become very easy.

                    The IoT Power station is not only useful for students but also mediates problems for HvA employees. The station tracks power reels and registers students that use the station. 
                    By doing this power reels will not get lost anymore. Our IoT Power station also gives employees insight in usage data. This can be useful when assessing if there are enough power cables and how often the station is used.
